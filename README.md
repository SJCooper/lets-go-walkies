# Let's Go Walkies

Let's Go Walkies is a site that introduces people and their pets to a dog hiking group based in the north west of england. The site offers open and free information regarding events and allows people to sign up for event newsletters and updates. Let's Go Walkies is aimed at dog owners that enjoy socialising their pets and those who might prefer group walks and hikes as oppose to solitary ones. The aim of the site is to aid the growth of the community and to give dog walkers potential new ideas as to suitable dog friendly areas to take their dogs.

## Design And Planning

### Wireframes

- __Original Design__

  - The original wireframe for the site was created using Balsamiq. 
  - Whilst the finished site evolved drastically from the original sketched out wireframes, they provided a starting part for the sites creation.
  - The wireframe aided in the creation of the basic html structure which other elements were added to throughout the design process.

- __Color Swatch__

  - The chosen colors for the site were chosen to emphasize the nature based theme of the group. 
  - The colors were checked initially to make sure their contrast would be adequate in terms of readability using https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

### Features Left to Implement

While there are no features left unimplimented from the original scope of the site, there are features outlined below that I explored that could possibly be implimented as further addition to the site at a later time. This would require Javascript and as such is beyond the scope of this project as the projects focus was a HTML and CSS front end site.

- __Photo Submission__

  - A form with a file browser element to allow for community members to upload photos from events for submission to be added to the gallery page. 
  - This will add to the level of inclusion for community members.
  - This will add to the exposure for the group as photos could be shown and shared with people outside of the group by current group members.

- __Form Submission User Feedback__

  - As this project was a HTML and CSS front end focussed project, the user inputted information on the signup form opens on a seperate validation page. In future javascript may be inplimented to send an alert to the user to notify wether the form and information contained in it has been recieved correctly or not.

## Testing 

To begin testing the site I checked all user accesible links, forms and buttons worked in as expected in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. This included checking every link from every page at every responsive breakpoint size. As far as was observable there were no errors in any browser in terms of links and user interaction elements.

I then went on to test the site on physical devices available to me which are an iPhone X and iPad Pro (12.9 inch M1 model). This afforded me the opportunity to test landscape and portrait modes on both devices to check responsivness was behaving as expected and it was in every case.

Whilst testing on these apple devices I became aware of a bug in which the sign up form submit button was not styling as expected and instead was using some apparantly default iOS button stylings. I found a potential fix on Stack Overflow which seemed to resolve the problem with minimal additional CSS styling.

![iPad-bug-min](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7358665/155914253-634cec2d-c319-4ef3-b27a-e3cec990027d.PNG)
![iPhone-bug-min](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7358665/155914293-4157ed3c-0c1f-491f-a87d-a14db0269c14.PNG)

All responsive elements in each of these test cases worked and updated as expected.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
  - There was one warning for each of the events, gallery and signup pages stating they did not have headers. This was deemed to be a design choice and that the headers were not needed for those particular pages and did not effect the site in any negative way.

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  - There was one warning flagged as below which was directly related to the submit button iOS fix and was required for the site to style correctly. This did not impact any usability of the site.

- Lighthouse
  - I ran a lighthouse test case in Google Chrome and the results were acceptable with performance being the lowest but having drastically improved after compressing the site images and lowering their filesizes all to less than 1mb.

<img width="469" alt="lighthouse" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7358665/155916851-0c0909ba-ab75-4c9c-9486-e9693f65097f.png">

### Unfixed Bugs

There is a known issue in GitPod. I am currently unable to remove the now unused sign-up.png image from the repo without my system crashing. I have tried several solutions to this including full system reboots and closing down of every other program running but to no success. This is not impacting the sites deployment at all but should be noted as the file is no longer used anywhere in the site or README. It should be noted that this is seemingly not a bug but rather a system issue.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch (may show as Main Branch)
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
